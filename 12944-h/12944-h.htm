    <p>The origin of the phrase, <i>Le Coup de Jarnac</i>, is
    interesting, and the story is well told by Mr. <i>MAC</i>DOWALL
    in Mac<i>millan's Magazine</i>. Good, this, for "The Two
    Macs."</p>

    </div>

    <p>In <i>The Argosy</i>, edited by Mr. CHARLES WOOD, there are
    two good most seasonable Ghost Stories, by CHARLES W. WOOD, the
    "Rev. F.O.W." The first is not new, as there is a similar
    legend attached to several old Manor Houses, one of a Sussex
    Family House, the Baron had first-hand, from a witness on the
    premises. It lacked corroboration at the time, and is likely to
    do so.</p>

    <p>The Letters passing between a fine young English Cantab,
    "all of the modern style," and his family at home, are
    uncommonly amusing. <i>Harry Fludyer at Cambridge</i> is the
    title of the book, published by CHATTO AND WINDUS. Well, to
    quote the ancient witticism in vogue <i>tempore EDOUARDI RECTI
    et DON PAOLO BEDFORDI</i> (the great Adelphoi, or rather the
    great "Fill-Adelphians," as they were once called), "Things is
    werry much as they used to was" at Cambridge, and University
    life of to-day differs very little from that of yesterday, or
    the day before, or the day before that. "<i>Hæc olim meminisse
    juvabit</i>," when, half a century hence, the rollicking author
    of these letters&mdash;which, by the way, first appeared in
    <i>The Granta</i>&mdash;is telling his <i>Minimus</i> what "a
    dog," he, the writer, was, and what "a day he used to have," in
    the merry time that's past and gone. "His health and book!"
    quoth the Baron.</p>

    <p>A more muddle-headed story than <i>The Missing Member</i> I
    have not read for some considerable time.</p>

    <p>The Baron sends HACHETTE &amp; CIE.'S "<i>Mon Premier
    Alphabet</i>," and the moral tale of "<i>Mlle. Marie
    Sans-souci</i>," up to the nursery where they will be much
    appreciated by the little Barons.</p>

    <p>"LETT's get a Diary," quoth a Barren Jester, not <i>the</i>
    Baron DE B.W., who, had it not been Christmas time, would have
    expelled the witty youth. "No joke, if you please," quoth he,
    "about LETTS's Diaries. We may advertise these useful and hardy
    annuals in canine Latin and say, '<i>Libera nos</i>!'
    <i>i.e.</i>, Letts out!"</p>

    <p>BARON DE BOOK-WORMS &amp; Co.</p>

    <p><i>P.S.</i> I have it on the best authority that Mrs.
    SUTHERLAND EDWARDS, Author of <i>The Secret of the Princess; a
    Tale of Country, Camp, Court, Convict, and Cloister Life in
    Russia</i>, is about to produce a highly sensational work,
    entitled <i>The Bargain of the Barmaid; a Story of Claret,
    Cheese, Coffee, Cognac, and Cigar Life in London</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CINDERELLA, FIN DE SIÈCLE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Fairy Tale for Christmas.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The Lady Help was busy at her domestic duties when her
    Godmother knocked at the kitchen-door, and entered.</p>

    <p>"Alas, poor CINDERELLA!" said the Fairy, in a compassionate
    tone, "and so your stepmother and sisters have gone to the
    Prince's ball, and left you to cleanse the pots and pans?"</p>

    <p>"Thank you," returned her God-daughter; "I am perfectly well
    satisfied to be left with my books. As a matter of fact, dances
    bore me."</p>

    <p>And she carelessly glanced at some mathematical works that
    she had used when cramming for the Senior Wranglership.</p>

    <p>"Nonsense, my dear," responded the well-intentioned Fairy,
    "Get me a pumpkin, some mice&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Quite out of date," interrupted CINDERELLA. "I presume you
    intend to turn the pumpkin into a great coach, and so forth.
    Eh?"</p>

    <p>"Well," admitted the Fairy, taken aback, "ye-es."</p>

    <p>"Quite so. Believe me, the idea is distinctly old-fashioned.
    Pray understand, I don't say you can't do it. Nowadays, with
    EDISON and KOCH, it would be dangerous to suggest that anything
    was impossible. No, I merely object to travel in a conveyance
    that will naturally be redolent of the odours of the kitchen
    garden, and to be driven by a coachman derived from a
    rodent."</p>

    <p>"But this objection is contrary to precedent," urged the
    Fairy. "You ought to express unbounded delight, and then depart
    in your carriage with the greatest <i>éclat</i> possible."</p>

    <p>"You are most kind, but, if I am to do anything of
    <i>that</i> sort, I would prefer leaving the matter in the
    hands of Mr. Sheriff AUGUSTUS HARRIS who thoroughly understands
    the entire business."</p>

    <p>"It seems to me," said the Fairy, "you are very ungrateful.
    But surely you want a magnificent costume?"</p>

    <p>"Thanks, no; I get everything from Paris."</p>

    <p>"And you think of the feelings of your <i>modiste</i>, and
    ignore those of your poor old (but well-preserved) Godmother!"
    And the Fairy was nearly moved to tears.</p>

    <p>"Oh, I did not mean to pain you!" exclaimed CINDERELLA.
    "Stay, my dear Lady, do you believe in hypnotism? No? Well, I
    do, and exercise it. Pardon me!"</p>

    <p>And as she made a few passes, the Fairy sank into a mesmeric
    trance. Then, CINDERELLA desired that her Godmother should
    imagine that she had been the heroine of a Fairy Story.</p>

    <p>"Dear me," cried the now-satisfied dame, as she regained
    consciousness; "and so you went to the ball, lost your slipper,
    and married the Prince?"</p>

    <p>"That was the impression I wished to convey to you. And now,
    my dear, good Lady, I am afraid I must ask you to leave
    me."</p>

    <p>And as the Fairy disappeared, CINDERELLA resumed her
    self-imposed tasks of making an omelette and squaring the
    circle.</p>

    <h2>BETWEEN THE LEAVES;</h2>

    <h3>OR, HOW TO LET IN THE ADVERTISERS NEATLY.</h3>

    <h4>CHAPTER LXVII.</h4>

    <p>The fair girl stepped lightly into the room, and, having
    daintily removed the dust from her feet by wiping them on one
    of BIGLOW AND SONS' Patent Crocodile Matting Rugs (delivered
    carriage free within a radius of twelve miles of their
    establishment at Ludgate Circus) that was placed before the
    door, gave a hasty glance round the apartment. She saw at ones
    from the octagonal ebonised table three feet six, by two feet
    five inches, the afternoon lounge couch (as advertised), the
    gent's easy shake-down chair, ladies ditto, and half dozen
    occasional chairs, all upholstered in rich material in Messrs.
    MULGRAVE &amp; Co. of 170, Walbrook, City, E.C.'s best style,
    that a refined taste inspired by a wholesome economy had been
    exercised in the furnishing of the apartment, and she turned to
    the old Duke with a grateful nod of recognition.</p>

    <p>"What," he asked, in a feeble voice, "is it my own ANGELICA?
    Surely it is! Come, my child, let me look at you?" He turned up
    the burner of a BOYCOTLE's Patent Incandescent Gas Lamp (price
    13s. 9d. with full paper of instructions complete), and as he
    stood erect in his rich calico-lined fox-fur dressing-gown
    (supplied in three qualities by BROHAM &amp; Co, with a
    discount of 15 per cent. for cash), he looked, every foot of
    him, a worthy scion of that ancient family of which he was the
    last living representative. "Let me look at you," he again
    repeated, drawing his neatly-dressed granddaughter more fully
    into the light before him. As it fell upon the graceful curves
    of her lissom figure, it was easy to perceive that she was
    wearing one of Madame BEAUMONT's celebrated Porcupine Quill
    Corsets, which lent a wonderful finish to a two-guinea
    tailor-made gingham cloth "Gem" costume, braided with best silk
    (horn buttons included), which showed off her young form to
    such advantage.</p>

    <p>He would have added more, but a sudden pallor stole over his
    complexion, and he reeled towards a chair.</p>

    <p>In an instant the bright girl was on her knees at his side.
    "Dear Grandfather, you are faint!" she cried, an expression of
    alarm suffusing her beautiful features.</p>

    <p>The Duke pointed to a small table&mdash;"My Liquid Pork!" he
    gasped. "Ah! of course!" was her quick response, as she bounded
    across the room, and returned with an eleven-and-sixpenny
    bottle of "BOLKIN's Liquid Pork, or, the Emaciated Invalid's
    Hog-wash"&mdash;a stimulating, flesh-creating, life-sustaining
    food; sold in bottles at 1<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i>, 2<i>s.</i>
    9<i>d.</i>, 5<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, and 11<i>s.</i>
    6<i>d.</i>,&mdash;of which she quickly poured out half a
    tumbler, and raised it to the quivering lips of the staggering
    old nobleman by her side. "How foolish of me not to have
    thought of this before!" she continued, replenishing the glass,
    which he emptied in feverish haste.</p>

    <p>"I save threepence-halfpenny in a sovereign," he went on, a
    wicked twinkle kindling in his eye as he spoke, "by taking the
    eleven-and-sixpenny size&mdash;and that <i>is</i> a
    consideration, my dear. If you don't think so now, with all
    your young life before you, you will when you come to be my
    age!"</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:12%;">
        <a href="images/303-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/303-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>He sank back in his arm-chair as he spoke, apparently about
    to deliver himself to the calm delights of a retrospective
    <i>rêverie</i>. But he was not destined to enjoy it. At that
    moment a whiff of stifling smoke, quite choking in its
    intensity, forced itself under the door. In another moment the
    matter was soon explained. With a wild rush the butler burst
    into the room.</p>

    <p>"Fly, your Grace, for your life!" he cried; "the place is on
    fire!"</p>

    <p>A blaze of flame that followed the terrified menial into the
    room, only too truly corroborated his statement. In a another
    moment the fire had seized hold of the new furniture, and in
    greedy fury, as if it were some demon spirit, licked the walls
    with great tongues of flame.</p>

    <p>"In the cupboard, my dear," said the Duke, the proud blood
    of his race coming to his aid in a perfect and commanding
    coolness in the face of the terrible danger that faced him,
    "you will find three cans of JOBSON's Patent Fire Annihilating
    Essence. It is advertised as infallible. Give one to the
    butler, take one yourself, and give the third to me. This
    appears to be a good opportunity for testing its efficacy."</p>

    <p>The quick bright girl instantly obeyed his injunction. The
    cans were distributed, and opened. A colourless gas was
    liberated. In a few seconds the flames were entirely
    quenched.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said the old Duke, flinging himself back into his
    armchair with a sigh of relief. "And now, ANGELICA, my dear,
    you can tell me why you came to see me!"</p>

        <h3>A FAIR WARNING.</h3>

        <p>"DADDY, I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME FIVE SHILLINGS A WEEK
        POCKET-MONEY!"</p>

        <p>"I COULDN'T DO IT, MY LITTLE CHAP. IT'S TOO MUCH!"</p>

        <p>"WELL, I MUST HAVE IT. IF YOU WON'T, I SHALL GO AND
        BET!'</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>to the Fiancée</i>). Well, my dear, I
    don't approve of young men getting engaged until they have some
    prospects of being able to marry, and dear ALGY was always my
    favourite brother, and I've seen so much misery from long
    engagements. However, we must hope for the best, that's
    all!</p>

    struck <i>me</i>, MARTHA. <i>One</i> waiter would have been
    quite sufficient, and if JAMES <i>must</i> be grand and give
    champagne, he might have given us a little <i>more</i> of it;
    I'm sure I'd little more than foam in <i>my</i> glass! And
    every plate as cold as a stone, and you and I the only people
    who were not considered worthy of silver forks, and the
    children encouraged to behave as they please, and JOSEPH
    PODMORE made such a fuss with, because he's well off&mdash;and
    not enough sweetbread to go the round. Ah, well, thank
    goodness, we needn't dine here for another year!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Chipperfield</i> (<i>at the door</i>). Sorry to cut
    you short in your cigar, Uncle, and you LIMPETT; but fact is,
    being Christmas night, I thought we'd come up a little sooner
    and all have a bit of a romp.... Well, EMILY, my dear, here we
    are, all of us&mdash;ready for anything in the way of a
    frolic&mdash;what's it to be? Forfeits, games, Puss in the
    Corner, something to cheer us all up, eh? Won't anyone make a
    suggestion? [<i>General expression of gloomy blankness.</i></p>

    <p><i>Algernon</i> (<i>to his Fiancée&mdash;whom he wants to

    that one you played at home, with potatoes and a salt-spoon,
    <i>you</i> know?</p>

    <p><i>Zeffie</i> (<i>blushing</i>). No, <i>please</i>, ALGY! I
    don't know <i>any</i> games, indeed, I couldn't,
    <i>really</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Uncle JOSEPH will set us going, I'm
    sure&mdash;what do <i>you</i> say, Uncle?</p>

    <p><i>Uncle Joseph</i>. Well, I won't say "no" to a quiet
    rubber.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. C.</i> But, you see, we can't <i>all</i> play in
    that, and there <i>is</i> a pack of cards in the house
    somewhere; but I know two of the aces are gone, and I don't
    think all the court cards were there the last time we played.
    Still, if you can manage with what is left, we might get up a
    game for you.</p>

    <p><i>Uncle J.</i> (<i>grimly</i>). Thank you, my dear, but, on
    the whole, I think I would almost rather romp&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Uncle JOSEPH votes for romping! What do you
    say to Dumb Crambo? Great fun&mdash;half of us go out, and come
    in on all-fours, to rhyme to "cat," or "bat," or
    something&mdash;<i>you</i> can play that, LIMPETT?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Limpett</i>. If I <i>must</i> find a rhyme to cat, I
    prefer, so soon after dinner, not to go on all-fours for it, I
    confess.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.</i> Well, let's have something quieter,
    then&mdash;only <i>do</i> settle. Musical Chairs, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Algy</i>. ZEFFIE will play the piano for you&mdash;she
    plays beautifully.</p>

    <p><i>Zeffie</i>. Not without notes, ALGY, and I forgot to
    bring my music with me. Shall we play "Consequences"? It's a
    very quiet game&mdash;you play it sitting down, with paper and
    pencil, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Limpett</i> (<i>sardonically, and sotto voce</i>).
    Ah, this is something <i>like</i> a rollick now.
    "Consequences," eh?</p>

    <p><i>Algy</i> (<i>who has overheard&mdash;in a savage
    undertone</i>). If that isn't good enough for you, suggest
    something better&mdash;or shut up!</p>

    ZEFFIE says she will write down on the top of her paper "Who
    met whom" (must be a Lady and Gentleman in the party, you
    know), then she folds it down, and passes it on to the next,
    who writes, "What he said to her"&mdash;the next, "What she
    said to him"&mdash;next, "What the consequences were," and the
    last, "What the world said." Capital game&mdash;first-rate.

    said to him, 'Fowls are cheap to-day!' The consequences were
    that they never smiled again, and the world said, 'What price

    <h2>BLACK AND WHITE; OR, THE PHANTOM STEED!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Typical Ghost Story for Christmas, by a Witness of
    the Truth.</i>)</h4>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/305-1.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="The Phantom Steed." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>I was walking in one of the slums in the neighbourhood of
    Oxford Street, some years ago, and always fond of horse-flesh
    (I had driven&mdash;as a boy&mdash;a bathing-machine for my
    pleasure along the wild coast line of the great Congo
    Continent) was greatly attracted by a hack standing within the
    shafts of a cart belonging to a funeral furnisher. Like many of
    its class, the horse was jet black, with a long flowing tail
    and a mane to match. As I gazed upon the creature the driver
    came out of the shop (to which doleful establishment the
    equipage belonged) and drove slowly away. I felt forced to
    follow, and soon found myself outside a knacker's yard.
    Guessing the intention of the driver to treat his steed as only
    fit for canine food, I offered to purchase the seemingly doomed
    animal. To my surprise, the man expressed his willingness to
    treat with me, and suggested that I might have the carcase at
    the rate of 4<i>s.</i> 11¾<i>d.</i> a pound. Considering the
    price not excessive, I agreed, and, having weighed the horse at
    an automatic weighing machine, I handed over £100&mdash;in
    notes. Then the first strange thing happened. Before I could
    replace my pocket-book in its receptacle in my coat, the driver
    had absolutely vanished! I could not see him anywhere. I was
    the more annoyed at this, as I found that (by mistake) I had
    given him notes on the Bank of Elegance, which everyone knows
    are of less value than notes on the Bank of England. However,
    it was too late to search for the vendor, and I walked away as
    I could, leading by the bridle the steed I had so recently
    acquired.</p>

    <p>It was now necessary to get quarters for the night, but I
    found, at that advanced hour, that many of the leading hotels
    were either full or unwilling to supply me with a
    bedroom-and-stable-combined until the morning. I was refused
    firmly but civilly at the Grand, the Métropole, the Grosvenor,
    and the Pig and Whistle Tavern, South East Hackney. At the
    latter caravanserai, the night-porter (who was busying himself
    cleaning the pewter pots) suggested that I should go to Bath.
    Adopting this idea, I mounted my steed (which answered, after a
    little practice, to the name of <i>Cats'-meat</i>), and took
    the Old Kent Road until I reached St. Albans.</p>

    <p>It was now morning, and the old abbey stood out in grand
    outline against the glorious scarlet of the setting sun.
    Entering an inn, I called for refreshment for man and beast,
    and, having authority for considering myself qualified to act
    as representative of both, consumed the double portion.
    Thinking about the whiskey I had just discussed, as I rode
    along, I came to a milestone, standing on its head, and a
    sign-post in the last stage of hopeless intoxication. It was
    here that a police constable turned his lantern upon me with a
    pertinacity that apparently was calculated to challenge
    observation. Annoyed, but not altogether surprised, I declared
    my opinion that it was "all right," and fell asleep. When I
    awoke, I found that I had travelled some hundreds of miles,
    and, strange to say, my horse was as good as when it had
    started. From what I could gather from the signs on the road (I
    have been accustomed to Forestry from my earliest childhood),
    it seemed to me that, while I was slumbering, I must have
    passed Macclesfield, Ramsgate, Richmond (both in Surrey and in
    Yorkshire), and was now close to the weirdest spot in all
    phantom-populated Wiltshire&mdash;a place in its rugged
    desolation suggestive of the Boundless Prairies and BUFFALO
    BILL&mdash;Wild-Westbury! Greatly fatigued, I entered a second
    inn, and enjoyed a hearty meal, which was also a simple one. I
    am a liquidarian, and take no animal or vegetable food, and
    have not tasted fish for nearly a quarter of a century.</p>

    <p>When I wished to continue my journey to Bath, I found
    <i>Cats'-meat</i> so disinclined to move, that I thought the
    best thing to do in the interest of progress, was to carry him
    myself. He was very light&mdash;so light that I imagined the
    automatic weighing-machine must have been out of order when I
    tested it. Almost in a trance I walked along, until, stumbling,
    I fell, and dropped <i>Cats'-meat</i> into a well. And then
    another strange thing happened. The horse with its jet-black
    tail and mane, emerged from the water as white as snow!
    Apparently annoyed at the treatment to which it had been
    accidentally subjected, it fled away, and I lost sight of it
    amongst the hills that overlook Wild-Westbury. And then the
    strangest thing of all happened, and has been happening ever
    since!</p>

    <p>In clear weather, on the side of one of these hills,
    <i>Cat's-meat</i>, in the habit as he stood when he left the
    well on that fatal day, may be seen patiently waiting until the
    time shall arrive when he shall receive a coat of blacking, a
    companion steed to share with him his labours, and a hearse! I
    am not the only person who has seen him thus. The spectre (if
    it be a spectre) is known for miles around, and has been
    watched by thousands. Nay, more. On occasions of great
    rejoicing, when merry-making has been the order of the day or
    night, several <i>Cats'-meats</i> have appeared to the
    carousing watchers strangely blended together. Speaking for
    myself, if I have seen one I have seen half-a-dozen&mdash;nay,
    more&mdash;with hills to match! And those who do not believe me
    can continue the journey I once commenced, and (after I have
    wished them a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year) proceed
    to&mdash;Bath!</p>

    <h3>CHRISTMAS "CRACKERS."</h3>

    <p>Plum-pudding never disagrees with me, <i>however much I take
    of it</i>. No more do mince-pies, <i>no matter how many I
    eat</i>. Steaming hot-and-strong gin-punch is <i>the most
    wholesome beverage</i>; so, also, is brandy-punch. It can't
    harm anybody who, on the Pickwickian principle, "takes enough
    of it." Both beverages go admirably with cigars and pipes. If
    you have anything like a headache on Boxing-day morning, depend
    upon it, it comes from abstemiousness in drinking, eating, and
    smoking.</p>

    <h2>FIGHTING THE FOG.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Seasonable Hint.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have read several letters in the papers
    complaining of the fog, and asking not only how one is to
    protect the system from its injurious effects, but also
    soliciting information as to how one is to safeguard oneself
    against street accident, if obliged to quit the premises during
    its prevalence. The first is simple enough. Get a complete
    diver's suit, put it on, and let an attendant follow you with a
    pumping apparatus, for the purpose of supplying you with the
    fumes of hydro-bi-carbon (DAFFY's solution) in a state of
    suspension. This will considerably assist the breathing. To
    avoid street accident, wear an electric (SWANN) light, five
    hundred candle power, on the top of your hat, round the brim of
    which, in case of accident, you have arranged a dozen lighted
    night-lights. Strap a Duplex Reflector on to your back, and
    fasten a Hansom cab-lamp on to each knee. Let a couple of boys,
    bearing flaming links, and beating dinner-gongs, clear the way
    for you, while you yourself shout "<i>Here comes the Bogie
    Man!</i>" or any other appropriate ditty, through a fog-horn,
    which you carry in one hand, while you spring a policeman's
    ancient rattle vigorously with the other. You will, if thus
    provided, get along capitally. Be careful at crossings, for
    your sudden appearance might possibly frighten an omnibus horse
    or two, and cause trouble.</p>

    <p>I haven't tried all this <i>yet</i> myself, but a friend of
    mine at Colney Hatch assures me he has, and found it a great
    success. As I think, therefore, it may prove a boon to your
    numerous readers, I place it at your disposal with much
    pleasure, and have the honour to be, Sir,</p>

    <p>Your obedient servant, A CAUTIOUS CARD.</p>

    <h2>THE CHRISTMAS COLLEGE FAIRY.</h2>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.&mdash;<i>The Strange Visitor.</i></h4>

    <p>On the evening of the 24th of December, 1874, the Senior
    Dean of St. Michael's, the Reverend HENRY BURROWES, was sitting
    in his comfortable rooms in the Great Court. He had, for
    reasons of his own, decided to spend the Christmas Vacation in
    Cambridge. His bed-maker, Mrs. JOGGINS, had entered a mild
    protest, but it been unavailing. Mr. BURROWES was a man of
    forbidding aspect and of unbending character. During the five
    years that he had held his office, he had enforced discipline
    at the point of the bayonet, as it were, and he boasted with
    pardonable pride that he had broken the spirit of the
    haughtiest and least tractable of the Undergraduates. Everybody
    had been gated at eight o'clock. Many had been sent down. Tears
    and denunciations were alike unavailing. The ruthless Dean had
    pursued his course without flinching. A very mild reading-man
    had attempted his life by dropping a Liddell and Scott on to
    his head from a first-floor room. This abandoned youth had been
    screened by his comrades, and had ultimately escaped in spite
    of the efforts of the justly incensed Dean.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:42%;">
        <a href="images/309-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/309-1.png"
             alt="Rev. Dean Burrows and Mrs. Joggins." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>It was nine o'clock. The bells at St. Mary's were ringing
    the customary curfew. The Dean was seated before the fire in
    his arm-chair. An open book, a treatise on some abstruse
    question of pure mathematics, lay on the table by his side. He
    was meditating on his past exploits, and planning new
    punishments. But somehow there was a strange sinking at his
    heart. What could be the reason of it? The dinner in hall had
    been of the usual moderate excellence, he had only drunk a
    bottle and a half of claret. "Pshaw," he said, "this is folly.
    I have not been severe enough. Conscience reproaches me. I am
    unmanned." He rose and paced about the room. At this moment his
    door opened, and the familiar figure of Mrs. JOGGINS
    appeared.</p>

    <p>"Beg your pardon, Sir," she said, hesitatingly, "I thought
    you called."</p>

    <p>"No, Mrs. JOGGINS," said the Dean. "I did not call. Are you
    not rather late in College? Is it usual for you to stay&mdash;"
    Here the Dean stopped abruptly. He rubbed his eyes, and clung
    to his book-shelf for support. His hair stood on end, and his
    knees shook. In fact he expressed terror in a thoroughly
    orthodox manner, for he had suddenly become aware that there
    was in the face of Mrs. JOGGINS a strange radiance, and that
    two gossamer wings had suddenly appeared on her back in place
    of the substantial shawl she was wont to wear. Mr. BURROWES
    gazed * * * then consciousness forsook him.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.&mdash;<i>A Strange Story.</i></h4>

    <p>How long he lay he knew not. When he came to himself it was
    broad daylight, and he was walking through the Great Court hand
    in hand with Mrs. JOGGINS.</p>

    <p>"See," she said, "there is Dr. GORGIAS," and sure enough
    there stood the redoubtable Master in the centre of one of the
    grass-plots in a bright red dressing-gown and slippers, with an
    embroidered smoking-cap upon his head. He was engaged in
    distributing crumbs to a congregation of sparrows and thrushes
    and redbreasts.</p>

    <p>"Good morning, BURROWES," said the Master; "how's your poor
    feet? Can you catch. One, two, three, heads!" and with that he
    flung the crust he held in his hand at the astounded Dean, and
    landed him fairly on the right cheek. Dr. GORGIAS then executed
    a pirouette, kissed his hand to Mrs. JOGGINS, and disappeared
    into the Master's lodge. "From this good man," said Mrs.
    JOGGINS to the Dean, "you may learn a lesson of unassuming
    kindness; but time presses; we must hurry on. By virtue of the
    power vested in me by the Queen of the Fairies, whose
    ambassadress I am in Grantaford, I have summoned back to St.
    Michael's all the Undergraduates. You shall see them." In vain
    the miserable Dean protested that he had seen too much of them.
    The Fairy JOGGINS was inexorable. She waved her wand, a yard of
    butter congealed to the hardness of oak by the frosty morning,
    and in a moment the Court was filled with Undergraduates. They
    were all smoking, and suddenly the Dean became aware that he
    too had a lighted cigar in his mouth, and was puffing at it. At
    the same moment he discovered that he was wearing a
    disgracefully battered college-cap, and a brilliant "blazer,"
    lately invented by a rowdy set as the badge of their dining
    Club. He shuddered, but it was useless. He put his hand in his
    coat-pocket. It contained a bottle of champagne.</p>

    <p>The Undergraduates now formed a procession and began to
    defile past him. "Smoking in the Court, half-a-crown," said
    one, in a dreadful voice. "Mr. BURROWES irregular in his
    attendance at Chapel, gated at eight," roared a second. "Mr.
    BURROWES persistently disorderly, sent down for the term,"
    shouted a third; and then they all began to caper round the
    hapless man whom the Fairy Queen had betrayed into their power.
    They taunted him and reviled him. "You have mined our homes,
    poisoned our fathers' happiness, undermined the trusting
    confidence of our mothers. You have been a bad man. You must
    perish!" and thus the dreadful chorus went on while the Dean
    stood stupidly in the centre of the throng puffing violently at
    one of the largest cigars ever seen in St. Michael's. At last
    the Fairy waved her wand again, and in a moment the shouts
    ceased and the crowd disappeared. "See," she said, "the result
    of intemperate disciplinarian zeal!" But Mr. BURROWES neither
    heard nor heeded. He had collapsed.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.&mdash;<i>Wide Awake!</i></h4>

    <p>It was Christmas Morning. Mr. BURROWES was still sitting in
    his chair before the fire-place, but the fire was out. He woke
    and looked round. Mrs. JOGGINS had just come in, and was
    staring at him in surprise.</p>

    <p>"Lor, Sir," she said, "what a turn you give me, sitting here
    in your keepin'-room. I never knew you to do sech a thing
    before as sit up all night." But the Dean had fallen on his
    knees before her, and was babbling out prayers for pardon and
    vows of reform.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<i>A Christmas Morn.</i></h4>

    <p>In the following term the whole system of College management
    was changed. Mr. BURROWES from a tyrant turned into the most
    amiable of men. The Undergraduates became idyllic. Even Dr.
    GORGIAS submitted to the benign influence of the Fairy JOGGINS.
    But it is noticeable that Mr. BURROWES who still resides at St.
    Michael's, objects to any mention of the Christmas of 1874.
    This is the only exception to his universal amiability.</p>

    <p>"<i>Mon frère</i>" said DINARZADE JACQUES MORLEY to
    SCHEHERAZADE HARCOURT, "<i>si vous ne dormiez pas, je vous
    supplie, en attendant le jour, qui paraîtra bientôt, de me
    raconter un de ces beaux contes que vous savez.</i>"</p>

    <p>"Certainly, my dear JACK," said SCHEHERAZADE.</p>

    <p>Now DINARZADE did not like this flippant tone of address. He
    was, as has been recorded by SHAHSTEAD (a gentleman of whose
    patronage he is proud) not a man you may take liberties with.
    For SCHEHERAZADE, taking mean advantage of a French
    agglomeration of letters which did not represent his name, to
    hail him as "JACK" was characteristic, and therefore
    undesirable. But, as everybody knows, DINARZADE, at the
    approach of each successive morning, was obliged to make this
    appeal to his brother, in order to circumvent the bloodthirsty
    designs of the Sultan (for particulars of which, see original).
    So he dissembled his anger, and SCHEHERAZADE proceeded to tell
    the History of the Second Old Man, and the Black Dog.</p>

    <p>"Sire," he said, "whilst the Merchant and the First Old Man,
    who conducted the hind, went their way, there arrived another
    Old Man, who led a black dog, and who forthwith proceeded to
    relate his history. 'We were, you know,' he remarked, leaning
    wearily on his staff, 'two brothers, this dog that you see, and
    myself. In early life we were not tied by those bonds of
    affection that should exist in family circles. In fact, on one
    occasion, I had to put my brother in prison. He had not at that
    period assumed the four-footed condition in which you now
    behold him. He walked about on two legs, like the rest of us,
    ate and drank, made love, and made merry. After he had been in
    prison some time, successful interposition was made on his
    behalf by a friend named Le Sieur O'SHAY. But that (as RUDYARD
    KIPPLING observes) is another story.</p>

    <p>"'Some time after my brother came to me and proposed to make
    a long journey involving close business relations with him. I
    at first declined his proposition. "You have been in business
    some time," I said to him, "and what have you gained? Who is to
    assure me that I shall be more fortunate than you?"</p>

    <p>"'In vain he encouraged me to stake my fortune with him, but
    he returned so often to the charge that, having through six
    years constantly resisted his solicitations, I at last yielded.
    I realised all my property, took my brother into partnership,
    stocked our vessel exclusively with Home Rule goods, and set
    out on our voyage.</p>

    <p>"'We arrived safely, did a great stroke of business with our
    wares, bought those of the country, and set forth on our return
    voyage. Just as we were ready to re-embark I met on the
    seashore a lady, not at all bad looking, but very meanly
    dressed. She approached me, kissed my hand, begged me to take
    her for my wife, and conduct her to my home across the sea.
    This may seem to our friend JACK MORLEY a somewhat hasty
    proceeding. JACK is a philosopher, but I am the Second Old Man,
    a mere child of nature. I took her into Bond Street, and bought
    her a new dress, and, having duly married her, we set sail.
    Perhaps I should add that her maiden name was IRELAND.</p>

    <p>"'My brother and she got on very well at first, and he
    loudly professed to share the esteem and (considering she was
    my wife I may say) affection with which I regarded her. But
    suddenly a change came over him. One night whilst we slept he
    threw us overboard into the sea. My wife turned out to be a
    fairy, and, as you may imagine, she was not born to be drowned.
    As for me I was, so to speak, on my way to be as dead as a
    herring, when she seized me and transported me to an isle. When
    it was day the fairy said to me, "You see, my husband, that in
    saving your life I have not badly recompensed you. I am, as you
    doubtless begin to suspect, a fairy. Finding myself on the
    seashore when you were about to embark, I felt strongly drawn
    towards you. Desiring to prove the goodness of your heart, I
    presented myself in the disguise with which you are familiar.
    It was, I admit, a trifle shabby. You have used me generously.
    I am delighted to have found occasion to repay you; but as for
    that brother of yours, I am death on him. I shall never rest
    till I have taken his life."</p>

    <p>"'"I beg you to do no such thing," I said.</p>

    <p>"'"I will sink his vessel and send him to the bottom of the
    sea," she insisted.</p>

    <p>"'After much endeavour I managed to appease her wrath, and
    in the twinkling of an eye, before you could say "Ali Baba!"
    she had transported me back to my own house. On entering I
    found this black dog who stared strangely at me.</p>

    <p>"'"My husband," said the fairy, "do not be surprised to see
    this dog here; he is your brother. He has behaved in a most
    shocking way towards you. He has maligned you, misrepresented
    you, threatened you, even called you a Grand Old Spider. I have
    condemned him to remain in this state till you have concluded
    your little transactions in Home Rule."</p>

    <p>"'"But my dear!&mdash;" I said.'"</p>

    <p>At these words SCHEHERAZADE, remarking that it was daybreak,
    ceased to pursue his narrative.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
